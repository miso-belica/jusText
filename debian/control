Description: Python module for removing boilerplate content.
 jusText is a package created by Jan Pomik√°lek for removing boilerplate content
 such as navigation links, headers, and footers from HTML pages. It is designed
 to preserve mainly text containing full sentences and it is therefore well 
 suited for creating linguistic resources such as Web corpora.
